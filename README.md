# employee-tree
Implementation of tree. University project ("OOP", HSE).

It is the last lab in subject OOP.  
We had initial code and should be to add features which were written in .doc file (except of 5th item).  
In general, we implemented all features written in .doc file (except of 5th item).

#####Only one thing: 
To change the image click on it!

#####Dependencies:
Big thanks for the library [jcalendar](http://toedter.com/jcalendar/) (GNU LGPL).  
The .jar file is in /lib folder.

#######Notes:
If you need to build .jar, you have to write resourceLoader for images [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCoed3MKpEA).  
All the rest works perfectly ;)
